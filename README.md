BAD CS209


 

This is the page you land on:
HEADER
-	Colours clash, hard on the eyes
-	Does not match the footer, footer font colour is hard to read 
SIDEBAR:
-	RULES are small, easy to miss, bad formatting 
-	What does top 1% mean 
-	Suggested groups: images are lost , don’t tell you what they were. 
-	Not in alignment, confusing to read , where to go next ?
MAIN BOX:
-	Rules are confusing, no context given, no signifiers, not everything is explained 
o	(what is xy) 
o	(there are no buttons called create post: there is one called press me)
o	Edit post: is not editing, its to re-blog, that is not the right symbol. 
o	Rules are unclear
-	Help could be hidden,  click if needed
-	POST button , red font is bad and hides text
-	Post description  is not a good description, more like post content (?)
-	Two different fonts in the post creation. 
WHEN YOU CREATE POST: 
 

-	Upvote and downvote arrows are the wrong colour, should be switched
-	The number next to the downvote arrow needs more signifiers 
-	The icon and edit buttons are switched, 
-	Red edit icon is hidden and should be more clear, more contrasting
-	I don’t like the colours chosen for text 
-	Editing is confusing, instead of going back to the original creation box, you should be able to edit wherever the post is on the screen. 
-	Should ask for confirmation before deleting
-	UPVOTE: should only work once and can be taken away when pressed again, same with DOWNVOTE
